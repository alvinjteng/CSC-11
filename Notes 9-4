Von Neumann Architecture

Stored Program Computer Concept
- 1943: ENIAC
  - hard-wired program -- settings of dials, tube and switches
- 1944: Beginning of EDVAC
  - included program stored in memory.
- 1945: John von Neuman
- The basic structure proposed in the draft became known as the von Neumann machine.
  - a memory, containing instructions and data
  - a processing unit, for performing arithmetic and logical operations.
  - a control unit, for interpreting instructions.
  
Basic Von Neumann Architecture
- ALU: Arithmatic Logic Unit
- TEMP: Temporary memory on the chip.
  - Registers
    - L1 Cache
    - L2 Cache
    - L3 Cache * Some CPUs have these
    - RAM(random access memory)/ROM(read-only memory)
    - Secondary storage
- PC: Program Counter (pointer to next intersection in memory)
- IR: Instruction Register
- MAR: Memory Address Register - holds address to a memory CPU
- MDR: Memory Data Register - holds data to read of write to memory

- To read a locations (A):
  1. Write the address (A) into MAR.
  2. Send a "read" signal to the memory.
  3. Read the data from MDR.
- To write a value (X) to a location (A):
  1. write the data(X) to the MDR.
  2. Write the address (A) into the MAR.
  3. Send a "write" signal to the memory.
