Why comuter architecture and assembly language?
- to work with the computer at the chip level (CPU)
- we can take advantage of cpu features that high level compilers often disregard.
1. work with code at bit level for performance increase. (5% to 200%+) 
  - upgrades as little at 0.5% could be worth it depending on what for, for example video games it would be.

CPU:
1. Fetch instruction (machine code byte code)
2. Decode the byte code.
  a. sets up the cpu to perform the action required by particular instruction.
3. Execute the instruction.
4. Write data back if needed.

Intel:
(A = accumulator) AX <-- 16 bits, AL, AH, EAX (extented accumulator), RAX\
(B = base) BX, BL, BH, EBX, RBX\
CA, CL, CH, ECX, RCX\
DX, DL, DH, EDX, RDX\
SI (source index), DI (destination index) EDI, RDI, RSI, RDI\
XMM0-XMM31\

ARM CPI:
R0 - R15 <-- 32 bits
